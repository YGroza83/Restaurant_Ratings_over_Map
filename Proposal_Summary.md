## Summary:
##Do certain states have higher rating than the rest of the US?

We found that certain states do have higher ratings throughout the US.  The highest was the District of Columbia along with New Jersey.  This could draw a few conclusions like population density.
Just to add we also found the states that had the lowest ratings throughout the US.  The lowest was Nevada and Oklahoma.  Population density could play a large factor in this score.

##Which states have the highest number of rating counts?

We found that the states with the highest number of rating counts were DC and New Jersey which we believe is correlated with the fact that those states have a higher rating overall.
The states with the lowest rating counts were North Dakota and South Dakota, we believe that this could be because of low population density or a smaller pool of restaurants available.

##Do higher priced restaurants have higher ratings?

We certainly found that higher priced restaurants have higher ratings but we also found that the higher priced restaurants have little to no ratings that were lower.  This could bring up a few assumptions, higher priced restaurants are not able to stay operational if having a large number of lower ratings or people tend to have their expectations met at a higher priced restaurant and tend to be more generous with reviews.
